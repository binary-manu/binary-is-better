<p>ELF static libraries are simply collections of relocatable object files,
plus a symbol table that maps symbols to the object file that defines
it. They are usually built using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ar</code> tool.</p>

<p>As a general rule, when such a library is used in a link editor
invocation, the linker will not simply add all the relocatable files
from the library to the output artifact (unless we explicitly request it
to do so). Instead, it will perform selective extraction: only those
files which are required to satisfy symbol references the linker has
already seen will be used. Other files will not take part in the linking
process.</p>

<p>The situation is a little more complex than what the wording above may
indicate. This is mainly because there is some confusion about what a
<em>defined symbol</em> actually is. If we refer to <a href="">Oracle’s Linker Guide</a>,
we’ll notice that, for the purpouse of link editing, symbols may fall in
3 different classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>undefined</strong> symbols are easy: they give the name of a symbol we want
to refer to, but without providing a definition, so that we do not
know were the symbol lives or its size. It is the linker’s job to find
an appropriate <em>definition</em> for this symbol, maybe in a different
object file. They typically arise from (but not only) global
declarations in C files, for example this snippet:</p>

    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">extern</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i_am_undefined</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>would result in an undefined symbol in the compiled relocatable file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>defined</strong> symbols are also easy: in contrast to undefined symbols,
they provide a complete definition for a symbol, including its
position within an relocatable object file (or in memory, for
executables and shared objects) and its size. Among other things, they
are generated by initialized C variables:</p>

    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i_am_defined</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>tentative</strong> symbols are more complex: they are ideally somewhere
halfway between undefined and defined symbols. They don’t come with a
position into the file; instead, they provide an <em>alignment
constraint</em>. They basically declare: “I don’t care were you put this
symbol within the program, but wherever it ends, its address must be a
multiple of the alignment I provide”. For example, a tentative symbol
with an alignment of 4 may be allocated into the final executable so
that it is loaded in memory at address 0x100000, but not 0x100001.</p>

    <p>The basic idea is that, at the end of linking, if a certain symbol
name has only been seen as a tentative symbol (plus any undefined
symbols), the tentative one gets defined somewhere by the linker.
Since tentative symbols are intended to be initialized with 0, they
usually end up into the BSS, to avoid wasting precious bytes from the
data section.</p>

    <p>Conversely, if the linker finds a defined symbol with the same name
somewhere in a different object file, the tentative definition is
ignored and the defined symbol replaces it.</p>

    <p>There is also a special case covering what happens if the linker sees
multiple homonymous tentative symbols but with different sizes: it
retains the symbol with the larger size.</p>

    <p>The primary source of tentative symbols are uninitialized C globals:</p>

    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i_am_tentative</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This apparently odd behaviour can be used to define the same symbol in
multiple object file and automatically have the linker merge them
instead of spitting out an error about multiple defined symbols:
multiple tentative symbols do not clash among themselves or against
defined symbols. Within ELF relocatable files, they are represented as
symbols defined in the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHN_COMMON</code> section; for this, they
are also called COMMON symbols.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Symbols also have <em>binding</em>, which may be either <em>weak</em> or <em>global</em>
(<em>local</em> binding is not considered, as local symbols cannot be used
outside their own object file and thus do not pertain to linking).
Global symbols have higher priority that weak symbols, so if the linker
must choose between a weak and a global symbol, it will choose the
latter. Also, weak symbols get special treatment when static libraries
are involved: no file is extracted from a library if its only use would
be satisfying a weak symbol.</p>

<p>I have noticed that <em>weak tentative</em> symbols are somewhat a mysterious
entity. In fact, it seems that compilers refuse to emit them.  Consider
a simple global undefined C variable like this:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we compile a file containing just this definition and read its symbol
table, we get:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>7: 0000000000000004     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  COM foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is perfectly fine, as our tentative C definition produced a COMMON
global symbol, whose section index is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHN_COMMON</code>. Now, let’s try again
with:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#pragma weak foo
</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time we get:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>7: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  WEAK   DEFAULT    3 foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What? The symbol ended up into a real section, so clearly this is not a
common symbol. If we take a look at the sections we find:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ 3] .bss              NOBITS           0000000000000000  00000040
0000000000000004  0000000000000000  WA       0     0     4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the symbol actually ended up into the BSS. This was to be expected,
since undefined globals in C are initialized to 0 and storing them into
the BSS saves space. However, we may have expected a symbol with weak
binding and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHN_COMMON</code> section index. This is not the case. The
resulting symbol is undistinguishable from a zero-initialized C global
variable. So, when we talk about <em>weak tentative</em> symbols in the rest of
this article, we should remember that such symbols are technically
equivalent to weak defined symbols.</p>

<p>Now back to static libraries. What makes the documentation ambiguous is
that it uses the expression “defined symbol” in a somewhat unclear way.
Given the 3 classes above, one would says that only the first class
is actually being referred. Conversely, when talking about “undefined
symbols” or “symbol references”, one would think only the second class
is involved. This leaves tentative definitions behind and does not
clarify the behaviour that applies to them. Here I want to clarify the
exact behaviour.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see what happens exactly when we throw a static
library into a linking operation in which a relocatable file has already
mentioned a symbol, which also appears in one of the library’s object
files: will it be extracted or not?</p>

<p>Basically, we have a link command like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ld -o a.out first.o lib.a
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib.a</code> holds a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code>, and both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first.o</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code>
mention a symbol with the same name.</p>

<p>In the discussion that follow, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code> refers to GNU <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code>. While it is just
an implementation of an ELF linker, it is widespread enough that it can
be used to check what actually happens in some corner cases. I also test
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gold</code>, which is also shipped alongside the GNU binutils. The versions
used for the tests are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ LANG=C ld -v
GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.33.1
$ LANG=C ld.gold -v
GNU gold (GNU Binutils 2.33.1) 1.16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have tried matching all symbol cases (weak/global
undefined/tentative/defined) in the relocatable file against all symbol
cases in the archive. This is what happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the symbol in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first.o</code> symbol is weak, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code> is not extracted
from the archive. This not only means, as clearly stated in the
documents above, that weak undefined references are never used to pull
files from archives. It also means that defined symbols in archives
will never take precedence over tentative symbols in relocatable
files, something that would have happened had <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code> been passed
directly to the linker. Also, tentative symbols are never merged in
this case, so if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code> contained a tentative definition larger
than a tentative definition in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first.o</code>, there would be no merging.
Again, this is contrary to what happens when linking relocatable files
directly.</li>
  <li>if the symbol in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first.o</code> is undefined (and, because of the previous
point, it has global binding) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code> is extracted from the archive
if it provides a tentative or defined symbol. The binding of the symbol
in the archived file is irrelevant.</li>
  <li>if the symbol in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first.o</code> is tentative (and, again, has global
binding), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second.o</code> is pulled only if its symbol is defined and has
global binding. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gold</code> does not extract the file in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table details the description above by listing every case:</p>
