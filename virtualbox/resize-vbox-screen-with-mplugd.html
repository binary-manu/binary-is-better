</ul><p>Users of <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> know that one of its nicest features
is <em>automatic guest screen resizing</em>. Basically, every time you perform
an action that causes the VM window to change its size (i.e. switch it
between fullscreen and windowed mode, or change its size by dragging a
border) the guest will receive an event that will cause it to change the
screen resolution to match the effective window size. This means that,
when fullscreen mode is entered or exited, you don’t have to open the
guest’s screen settings and change the resolution manually. Proper

<h2 id="guest-additions-and-their-problems">
<a class="anchor" href="#guest-additions-and-their-problems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guest additions and their problems</h2>

<p>This feature works by means of the <em>guest additions</em>, extra software
that needs to be installed inside the guest and that provides tighter
integration with the hypervisor.</p>

<p>Since VirtualBox 6.0, it is possible to choose the type of emulated
graphics adapter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxVGA</code> is a legacy adapter that is recommended for older OSes;</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxSVGA</code> is recommended for modern Windows systems;</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VMSVGA</code> is recommended for modern Linux systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, this is the theory. It looks like that any recent Linux system
should go with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VMSVGA</code>. However, I have encountered a number of issues
with that adapter, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatic screen resizing not working even when the guest additions
are installed and exactly matching the version of the running
hypervisor, if the additions come from prepackaged binaries of my
distro. I needed to manually install them using the VirtualBox ISO to
get them working;</li>
  <li>even after fixing the point above, I got poor 2D performance in
everyday desktop activity, such as very slow window dragging, portions
of the screen showing as solid black and, more importantly, frequent
VM crashes.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if I ignore the recommendation and keep using the legacy
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxVGA</code> adapter, things get better, much better. No crashes, black
areas and windows can be dragged at a decent speed. But there is a price
to pay: automatic screen resizing no longer works with Linux guests if
they are not using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VMSVGA</code> adapter. So you can basically choose
between an unstable VM with working autoresize or a stable one without
it.</p>

<p>Luckily, we are <em>not</em> forced to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VMSVGA</code> to have working
screen resizing.</p>

<h2 id="enter-mplugd">
<a class="anchor" href="#enter-mplugd" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mplugd</code>
</h2>

<p>Under a Linux VirtualBox machine with the guest additions installed,
every time we resize the guest window, the system can immediately detect
the new resolution. We can see that by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code> after poking
with the window size. The system alone, however, will not take any
action when that happens. It is a VirtualBox additional component,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxClient</code>, which listens for window size changes and adapts the
screen to follow. As said above, this only works if using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VMSVGA</code>
adapter.</p>

<p>However, since the window size can be read by any system tool, couldn’t
we use a different tool to listen for resolution changes in place of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxClient</code> and then call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code> to change the screen resolution on
the guest?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, and such a tool already exists: <a href="https://github.com/anyc/mplugd">mplugd</a>.  It
a generic event listener based on plugins, which matches events against
rules to execute when a certain thing happen. You can write rules such
as “when event X happens, execute script Y”.</p>

<p>Since it already supports X events via a dedicated plugin, it can be put
into immediate use by telling it to adjust the screen resolution when a
screen change event happens.</p>

<p><em>Note: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mplugd</code> is written in Python 2, which has been retired at the
beginning of 2020. Nevertheless, this utility is extremely useful and
still working, so until it is ported to Python 3 or something better
comes out, it is a good way to work around VirtualBox problems.</em></p>

<p>Let’s see how we can install and configure it. The following sections
show how to do it on an <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system, but the general
principles hold for any distribution.</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-configuration">
<a class="anchor" href="#installation-and-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>Under Arch Linux, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mplugd</code> is available via the AUR, so you can use your
favourite helper to install it, or do it manually. To handle X events, it
needs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python2-xlib</code>, which must be installed separately.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python2-setuptools</code> are also needed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pacman -Syu python2-setuptools
yay -Su mplugd-git python2-xlib 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once installed, rule definitions can be placed globally under
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/mplugd/action.d</code> or locally under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.mplugd/action.d</code>. Since
we want screen resizing to work for every user, we go for the first
location.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Edit /etc/mplugd/action.d/vboxresizing.rules
[rule vboxresizing]
on_type=OutputChangeNotify
true_exec=xrandr --output %event_name% --auto
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are asking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mplugd</code> to invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code> every time a video output
changes. The name of the output to be acted upon (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VGA-1</code>) is
derived from the event and made available for substitution as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%event_name%</code>.</p>

<p>Last, we must ensure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mplugd</code> is started every time a user logs
in. Since the package doesn’t come with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd</code> unit, we will put a
global desktop entry for it under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/xdg/autostart/</code>, so that every
user gets it for free:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Edit /etc/xdg/autostart/mplugd.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=mplugd
NoDisplay=True
Exec=/usr/bin/mplugd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Starting from the next login, the guest screen should automatically
resize, even when using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VBoxVGA</code> adapter.</p>
